Practice Using HTML5 Video, Audio, and Forms
=============
**Contributors:** Victoria Cano-Calhoun and Jay Diran Sweet

**Summary:** For this project we wanted to use the audio and video tags, as well as create a simple form that illustrated best practices.

Our idea was to create a small website that allows users to listen to music and watch music videos based on their current mood.
